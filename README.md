### About VAC and other Anti-Cheats
Custom Anti-Cheats - Almost all custom Anti-Cheats(Like LILAC, SMAC) **detect any Client-Side autobhop**, so - do not use this autobhop or another autobhop created by other peoples on Competitive Servers(T1, 100 Tickrate) or on other servers that use a custom Anti-Cheat.

VAC - **Use at your own risk**, there is no autobhop that can't be detected, there is always a chance of a ban
